# Tivi üì∫ (work-in-progress üë∑üîßÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚õè)

**This is not an official Google product**

Tivi is a **work-in-progress** TV show tracking Android app, which connects to
[Trakt.tv](https://www.trakt.tv). It is still in its early stages of development and currently
only contains two pieces of UI. It is under heavy development.

## Android development

Tivi is an app which attempts to use the latest cutting edge libraries and tools. As a summary:

 * Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
 * Uses [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) 2
 * Uses all of the [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/): Room, LiveData and Lifecycle-components
 * Uses [dagger-android](https://google.github.io/dagger/android.html) for dependency injection

## Development setup

First off, you require the latest Android Studio 3.0 (or newer) to be able to build the app.

### Code style

This project uses [ktlint](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint), provided via
the [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) gradle plugin, and the bundled project IntelliJ codestyle.

If you find that one of your pull reviews does not pass the CI server check due to a code style conflict, you can
easily fix it by running: `./gradlew spotlessApply`, or running IntelliJ/Android Studio's code formatter.

### API keys

You need to supply API / client keys for the various services the
app uses. That is currently [Trakt.tv](http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/),
[TMDb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/4/getting-started) and [Fabric](https://fabric.io) (for Crashlytics). You can find information about
how to gain access via the relevant links.

For Trakt.tv, set the redirect uri to `app.tivi://auth/oauth2callback`.

When you obtain the keys, you can provide them to the app by putting the following in the
`gradle.properties` file in your user home:

```
# Get these from Trakt.tv
TIVI_TRAKT_CLIENT_ID=<insert>
TIVI_TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET=<insert>

# Get this from TMDb
TIVI_TMDB_API_KEY=<insert>

# Get this from Fabric/Crashlytics
TIVI_FABRIC_API_KEY=<insert>
```

On Linux/Mac that file is typically found at `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` or in the project directory `tivi/gradle.properties`
